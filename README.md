## Bulldozer Price Prediction with Regression

The goal of this project is to predict the sale price of bulldozers based on various attributes such as machine specifications, usage, and historical data. The dataset used in this project is the Blue Book for Bulldozers dataset from Kaggle.

The project follows a typical machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The main steps in the notebook are:

- Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset and perform initial exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.

- Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format, and handling any other necessary data transformations.

- Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Train several regression models on the preprocessed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

- Model Selection and Tuning: Select the best-performing model based on evaluation results and perform further hyperparameter tuning if required.

- Predictions: Use the selected model to make predictions on unseen data and assess the model's generalization performance.
